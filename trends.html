        <h2>Key Modern Trends</h2>
            <p>Version control is no longer just about tracking files. It's the backbone of modern software development, integrating with a wide ecosystem of tools and practices</p>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>Cloud-Based Hosting Platforms:</strong> Services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are now ubiquitous. They provide a web interface and add many features on top of raw Git. For example, GitHub reported over 100 million developers in 2023.</p>
                <p><strong>Workflows (Pull/Merge Requests):</strong> These platforms standardized the "Pull Request" (PR) or "Merge Request" (MR) model. This provides a formal space to review, comment on, and approve code changes before they are merged into the main codebase, improving code quality.</p>
                <p><strong>Automation & CI/CD Integration:</strong> VCS is at the heart of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI/CD tools (like GitHub Actions or Jenkins) automatically trigger builds and tests whenever code is pushed to the repository. This ensures problems are detected quickly and makes it easy to deploy known, tested versions.</p>
                <p><strong>Social Coding:</strong> Platforms like GitHub created a "network effect" for open-source projects. They make it easy for anyone to "fork" (make a copy of) a project, make changes, and contribute back via a pull request. This has massively increased the scale of global collaboration.</p>
