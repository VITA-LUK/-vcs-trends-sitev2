            <h2>What is a Version Control System (VCS)?</h2>
            <p>Version control systems are key tools that help to track changes in files (usually source code) over time.</p>
            <p>They are necessary for collaboration, as they allow multiple people to work on projects together, keep a history of modifications, and go back to earlier versions if needed.</p>
